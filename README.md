## What is this?

A simple tv guide for finnish tv channels. See live example in [https://janka.la/tv/](https://janka.la/tv/).

## About

This project does not provide the data itself, all the data is fetched through Telia TV api. You need to run a proxy to be able to fetch the data from the api with this application. For your convenience this project also includes a simple proxy (so that you can test the app easily) but it may not be suitable for real usage nor is it really supported by this project.

## How to run the project?

- clone the repo
- run `yarn install`
- run `yarn start-proxy`
- run `yarn start`
