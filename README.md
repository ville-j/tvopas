## About
This project does not provide the data itself, all the data is fetched through Elisa viihde api. You need to run a proxy to be able to fetch the data from the api with this application. For your convenience this project also includes a simple proxy (so that you can test the app easily) but it may not be suitable for real usage nor is it really supported by this project.
